My Xcode Scheme
===========

These are theme's I've crafted to make hours of writing code a pleasant as possible. I've spent many years tweaking this colour scheme to work perfectly for me and I thought there may be others who could get as much benefit from this.

Rationale
------------

This is a set of light and dark colour schemes to help with writhing in day light or late at night. You should be using a colour scheme that compliments the ambient light in your surroundings. This helps prevent eye fatigue. You can also use a font size larger than you would normally need. This will help work longer with out feeling worn out.

Installation
------------

I recommend using [Alcatraz](https://github.com/supermarin/Alcatraz) to install these themes. It's a great Package Manager for Xcode where you can find many more themes and plugins .
You can also install them manually by dropping the .dvtcolortheme file in Xcode's `UserData` folder `~/Library/Developer/Xcode/UserData/FontAndColorThemes/`. Or throw this into a new Terminal window;

    git clone https://github.com/BenjaminBriggs/Xcode-Scheme.git
    cd Xcode-Scheme/
    mkdir -p ~/Library/Developer/Xcode/UserData/FontAndColorThemes/
    cp *.dvtcolortheme ~/Library/Developer/Xcode/UserData/FontAndColorThemes/
    cd ..
    rm -rf Xcode-Scheme/
